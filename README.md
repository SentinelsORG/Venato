# Project Venato

"**Venato**" is a piece of hardware that provides affordable surveillance and protection to people. The main focus of this project is to **showcase our skills in PCB design, circuit design, and RF design**. Additionally, we have taken this opportunity to create something useful for society.

<ins>**The Problem We Are Addressing**</ins>

Most surveillance systems in the market are expensive and require a complex installation procedure. At the time of developing this device, CCTV systems did not have a machine learning model to detect theft or danger. Do you have a protection or tracking system for your personal belongings, such as your wallet, travel bags, vehicle, or pets?

<ins>**The Basic Idea of Our Solution**</ins>

"Venato" is a modular device, meaning it consists of a main module (Venato Board) and other optional modules. Buyers can select the features they desire and obtain the necessary modules. The system can be upgraded using these modules. The main module houses all the computing power, battery, and features like GPS and GPRS. The base module includes the charging station and cameras. Additionally, we are developing a few extra modules that provide additional features for this setup.
