## What is "Venato"?

"**Venato**" is a piece of hardware that provides affordable surveillance and protection to people. The main focus of this project is to **showcase our skills in PCB design, circuit design, and RF design**. Additionally, we have taken this opportunity to create something useful for society.

<ins>**The Problem We Are Addressing**</ins>

Most surveillance systems in the market are expensive and require a complex installation procedure. At the time of developing this device, CCTV systems did not have a machine learning model to detect theft or danger. Do you have a protection or tracking system for your personal belongings, such as your wallet, travel bags, vehicle, or pets?

<ins>**The Basic Idea of Our Solution**</ins>

"Venato" is a modular device, meaning it consists of a main module (Venato Board) and other optional modules. Buyers can select the features they desire and obtain the necessary modules. The system can be upgraded using these modules. The main module (Venato) houses all the computing power, battery, and features like GPS and GPRS. The base module includes the charging station and cameras. Additionally, we are developing a few extra modules that provide additional features for this setup. The main module (i.e. Venato) is a credit card sized PCB that we designed specially for the ease of carrying. At the moment, we are still developing this module to be more compact, more featurestic and user friendly.

## Schematic Design

Please find below a brief explanation of the schematic design. I have included a screenshot of the schematic design for your reference, which is attached below. Additionally, you can access the PDF version of the schematic through the following link:

The schematic illustrates the electronic design of the main PCB (Venato). As depicted, we have utilized ESP32 and SIM808 chips to provide our PCB with all the necessary functionalities. Furthermore, you can observe the incorporation of meticulous design techniques aimed at enhancing the reliability and fail-safe nature of our product.

In addition to the previously mentioned schematic design of the main PCB, please note that we have also developed separate PCBs for the other modules. You can access the schematic designs for these modules in the provided repository.
